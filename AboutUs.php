      <h2>Illini Magic</h2>
      <h5>Springfield Illinois</h5>
      <p>The Illini Magic boys Basketball program was established in 2007 by  Mark Griffith. The Magic started out  as a one grade, school team, competing in local league play, as that team advanced age groups and had success, the team quickly became a competitive travel team. The program developed into a highly skilled Jr. High team, and added other age divisions, which had much success competing in very competitive tournaments at the high school level. </p> <p>Our goal is to provide a program for all players who desire to be better prepared for high school and college basketball, and to develop each player to reach their highest potential. We focus on learning fundamentals, sportsmanship, teamwork, and Leadership. </p> <p> For the 2019 season, we have expanded our program to 14u, 15u, 16u and 17u boys teams. We are very excited about the upcoming summer season, and the addition of some very talented, energetic coaches who have joined the program. Vince walker, Zach Steinberg, Casey Tuttle, Doug Houser, and Tony Cox.
